# Resend Email Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up Resend for sending invitation emails in ShowingSafe.

## Step 1: Sign Up for Resend

1. Go to https://resend.com
2. Click "Sign Up" and create a free account
3. Verify your email address

## Step 2: Get Your API Key

1. Once logged in, navigate to **API Keys** in the left sidebar
2. Click "Create API Key"
3. Give it a name like "ShowingSafe Development"
4. Select the appropriate permissions (you need "Sending access")
5. Click "Create"
6. **Copy the API key** - you won't be able to see it again!

## Step 3: Add API Key to Your Environment

1. Open your `.env.local` file (or create it if it doesn't exist)
2. Add this line:
   ```
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key_here
   ```
3. Replace `re_your_api_key_here` with the actual API key you copied
4. **Restart your dev server** for the changes to take effect

## Step 4: Test Email Sending

### For Development (Free Tier)

With the free tier, you can:
- Send emails to **any email address** using the test domain `onboarding@resend.dev`
- Send up to **100 emails per day**
- Send up to **3,000 emails per month**

The current setup uses `onboarding@resend.dev` as the sender, so you can test immediately!

### Try It Out

1. Go to your admin dashboard
2. Navigate to **Invitations**
3. Click "Send Invitation"
4. Fill in the email details
5. Check your inbox - you should receive a beautifully formatted invitation email!

## Step 5: Verify Your Domain (Production)

For production, you'll want to send emails from your own domain.

1. In Resend dashboard, go to **Domains**
2. Click "Add Domain"
3. Enter your domain (e.g., `showingsafe.com`)
4. Follow the instructions to add DNS records:
   - **SPF Record**: Proves your domain is authorized to send emails
   - **DKIM Record**: Adds a digital signature to your emails
   - **DMARC Record**: Tells email providers how to handle failed authentication
5. Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 48 hours, usually faster)
6. Once verified, update the email sender in your code:

### Update the Sender Email

In both API files, change:
```typescript
from: 'ShowingSafe <onboarding@resend.dev>'
```

To:
```typescript
from: 'ShowingSafe <noreply@yourdomain.com>'
```

Files to update:
- `/src/app/api/admin/invitations/route.ts` (line ~187)
- `/src/app/api/admin/invitations/[id]/route.ts` (line ~169)
